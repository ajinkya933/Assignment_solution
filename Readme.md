# Solution

### Attached is the jupyter notebook 
```
Mumbai Tile: (solution-2.ipynb) 

Crop Tile: (crop_segment.ipynb)

Clouds Tile: (cloud.ipynb)
```
### ML Flow

### SQL table details and running MLflow details are mentioned in PDF stored at mlflow_integration/Mlflow_assignment

Keep all logs of your data on MLflow + MySql(backend) using

``` Assignment_solution/mlflow_integration/mlflow_assignment.ipynb ``` 

Example run:
```
Mumbai tile
    -- run1
    -- run2
```

I change a matric in ML experiment and run that experiment,name this experiment(run1)
whenever I change a metric in experiment it forms a new run
